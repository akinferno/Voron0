Thank you to the Voron Design team for the all your hard work and amazing printers.

**DESIGN INTENT**

I wanted a way to open and close the tophat without tools.  This was the first idea to pop in my head. I have 3 other ideas for solutions that would eliminate the gap in the front. But they 
are a bit more complex in CAD, and I am learning as I go. So not sure when I will finish them. I am using and liking these, so figured I would share them.

On my first version, the handle was a flat plate outside the idler, and didn't require supports. But that made it longer, less convenient because it lifted above the plexi. This one is a 
couple mm lower, which looks a bit nicer and stays below the lid, barely. Drawback is now, you need supports. But it's easier to flip closed. Be aware, if the screws on the tophat are too 
tight, the cams will pull on that tab. I hope to get rid of that tab with Model B.

**PRINT INSTRUCTIONS**

_**Use standard voron print settings**_: 4 wall, 40% infill

They should be in print orientation. That meansâ€¦

The idlers should be printed with the cutout side down. That ensures alignment and that the back wall holding the 1515 extrusion is properly solid. I used supports due to the recessed notch 
for the handle. Model B won't require them. (It is possible to print it upright, like the original. That makes the latch area smooth and clean, but if the tab isn't supported well, it can 
break off or be bent weirdly. I had a 50% success rate in that orientation. 100% in the orientation suggested.)

The cams should be oriented with the Voron logo up. They need supports to ensure the proper shape of the cam lock. Model B won't require them.

**DEVELOPMENT**

I will create a Github this weekend and update this listing with a link. I will host the CAD file there. I am still figuring out the file/workflow management in CAD, so it is sloppy. Feedback 
on this mod is appreciated.
